# K8S

## Cluster

[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) is used for a lightweight kubernetes cluster.
This is deployed on a Ubuntu Server VM in Proxmox VE.

## Continuous deployment - GitOps

The kubernetes cluster is set up with [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io) for continuous deployment.

Flux uses GitOps practices and a pull-based deployment model.

The deployments are structured in a monorepo approach, see [Ways of structuring your repositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/).
Deployment manifests for all apps and services in the cluster are defined here in this repository for Flux to sync and deploy.

To **update flux**, run the following command and push the changes 
```
flux install \                                                                                                                  âŽˆ microk8s

--export > ./k8s/clusters/production/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
```


## Infrastructure

### Ingress controller

[ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) is used as the Ingress controller for Kubernetes.
This acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

### Cert manager

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is used to manage TLS certificates.
